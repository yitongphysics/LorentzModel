transitionRate.cpp compute the jumps between tetrahedrons and initial number of probes in each tetrahedron.
computeTransition.py compute the transition rate.

MarkovProperty.cpp compute the jumps between tetrahedrons and initial tetrahedron of each probe.
MarkovPropertyArray.py compute the velocity correlation, expected return probabillity and realized return probability.
