percolationSample2.py generate samples at percolation.
  nObstacles. nProbes -> tetrahedron information, position file
fireRadius.cpp vary the radius while keeping the connectivity unchanged.
  position file -> position file of many frames
tetraPackingFraction.cpp measure the packing fraction of each tetrahedron.
  tetrahedron information, position file of many frames -> packing fraction of percolating tetrahedrons at all frames
reasdPackingFractionArray.ipynb read the
  tetrahedron information, packing fraction of percolating tetrahedrons at all frames -> plots
